    <h1>TACTICS</h1>
    <ul>
      There is some tactics that i want to share:
      <li>
        <b>Team Composition:</b> Players must carefully choose and assemble a
        team of characters with complementary abilities and strengths. Each
        character brings unique skills to the table, such as offensive attacks,
        defensive buffs, healing abilities, or crowd control effects. Crafting a
        balanced team composition is crucial for success in battles.

        </p>
        <p><b>Fu Xuan</b> is the main tank</p>
        <p>

          rail, she can give a lot <b>Sp</b> from her ultimate
        </p>
        <p><b>Lynx</b> she just the healer</p>
        <br /><br />

        <h1>Character Speed</h1>
        <p>
          In Honkai Star Rail, speed plays a crucial role in determining the
          sequence of actions during battles, significantly influencing the
          outcome of each encounter. Here's how speed is impactful in the game:
        </p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <img src="photo/Screenshot 2024-04-01 184755.png" class="photo5" />
        <p>
          As the level of the trailblazer increases, the enemy's speed will
          become faster and often the enemy will attack first. If you don't have
          a character that can immediately provide a shield with their technique
          when entering the battle for the first time, your team will suffer a
          lot of damage. If the situation is against a boss, your team might be
          destroyed first
        </p>

        <b>Battlefield Awareness:</b> Understanding the terrain and
        environmental factors on the battlefield is essential for effective
        tactics. Players must analyze the layout of the battlefield, including
        obstacles, hazards, and advantageous positions, to position their
        characters strategically and gain the upper hand in combat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Ability Management: </b> Characters in Honkai Star Rail possess
        various abilities that can turn the tide of battle. Players must manage
        their characters' abilities wisely, considering factors such as cooldown
        times, resource costs, and synergy between skills. Timing the activation
        of abilities can maximize their impact on the outcome of battles.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Target Priority:</b> Prioritizing targets is a key tactical decision
        in battles. Players must assess the threat level of enemy units and
        prioritize eliminating high-priority targets or disrupting enemy
        strategies. Choosing the right targets to focus on can swing the
        momentum of battles in favor of the player's team.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Adaptation and Flexibility:</b> Tactical flexibility is crucial for
        success in dynamic battles. Players must adapt their strategies on the
        fly, reacting to changes in the battlefield, enemy movements, and
        unexpected events. Being able to adjust tactics and capitalize on
        opportunities can turn the tide of seemingly unwinnable battles.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Resource Management:</b> Efficient resource management is another
        important aspect of tactics in Honkai Star Rail. Players must carefully
        manage their characters' energy, health, and other resources throughout
        battles, balancing offensive and defensive actions while avoiding
        resource depletion or wastage
