    <h1>Turn Based Tactics</h1>
    <p>
      Honkai: Star Rail follows the gameplay style of classic Japanese
      role-playing games: players build up a lineup of characters and control a
      team of up to four in turn-based combat

    <p>
      Turn-based tactics (TBT) is a video game genre of strategy video games.
      They are turn-based simulations of operational warfare and military
      tactics in generally small-scale confrontations as opposed to more
      strategic considerations of turn-based strategy (TBS) games. Turn-based
      tactical gameplay is characterized by the expectation of players to
      complete their tasks using only the combat forces provided to them in a
      generally realistic (or at least believable) manner.

    <h1 id="id-gacha">gacha</h1>
    <p>In Honkai Star Rail, the gacha character system is a central feature that allows players to acquire new characters for their teams through a randomized draw process. Here's an explanation of how the gacha character system works, along with the pity system and its primary function:</p>

        Gacha Character System</b>

        Players use in-game currency or premium currency to participate in the gacha draw.
        The draw typically results in the acquisition of characters, which can vary in rarity and power levels.
        Characters may have different roles, abilities, and attributes, providing players with strategic options for team composition and battle tactics.
        The gacha system often includes a pool of available characters, with some being more desirable or sought after by players due to their strength or popularity.</li>
    <li><b>Pity System:</b>

      The pity system is a mechanic designed to increase player satisfaction and mitigate the randomness of the gacha draw.
      It works by guaranteeing that players will receive a specific reward after a certain number of unsuccessful draws or pulls.
      Typically, the pity system ensures that players will obtain a rare or high-value character if they haven't already received one within a predetermined number of draws.
      The pity counter increases with each unsuccessful draw, gradually increasing the likelihood of receiving the guaranteed reward until it is triggered.</li>
    <li><b>Primary Function:</b>

      The primary function of the pity system is to provide players with a safety net against unfavorable RNG (random number generation) outcomes.
      It reduces frustration and discouragement that can arise from repeatedly failing to obtain desired characters through the gacha draw.
      By offering a guaranteed reward after a set number of attempts, the pity system encourages player engagement and persistence.
      Additionally, the pity system helps to maintain a sense of fairness and transparency in the gacha character acquisition process, promoting a more positive player experience overall.</li>

    <h1 id="dot">Dot</h1>
    <p>What is DoT in Honkai: Star Rail? DoT is a pretty common abbreviation for “Damage over Time” in many different game genres. It describes status effects that deal damage to characters over a window of time, instead of once and immediately. Poison is the most common example of this in many video games</p>

        <p>
          <li>
            <b>Action Priority:</b> Speed determines the order in which
            characters and enemies take their turns. Units with higher speed
            stats act earlier in the turn order, allowing them to execute their
            actions before slower opponents. This gives players an advantage by
            enabling them to strategically plan their moves and potentially
            disrupt enemy strategies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Initiative Advantage:</b> A faster unit gains the initiative by
            being able to unleash their skills or attacks before the opponent
            can react. This allows players to control the battlefield tempo,
            applying pressure on the enemy team and gaining momentum in the
            battle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Positioning and Control:</b> Speed influences a character's
            ability to maneuver across the battlefield. Units with higher speed
            can reposition themselves more frequently, allowing players to
            control the flow of battle by adapting to changing circumstances and
            exploiting enemy weaknesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Combo and Chain Attacks:</b>Combo and Chain Attacks: Certain game
            mechanics and character abilities in Honkai Star Rail are triggered
            based on speed interactions. Faster units may initiate combo attacks
            or chain abilities more effectively, leading to devastating
            synergies and increased damage output.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Strategic Flexibility:</b> Speed offers players strategic
            flexibility by enabling them to dictate the pace of combat. Whether
            it's securing crucial objectives, evading enemy assaults, or setting
            up ambushes, units with higher speed provide players with greater
            options for executing their tactical plans.
